# UAV Search and Report

## Project Overview

Our project was aiming to solve one of the tasks of the [RobotX](https://robotx.org/) competition. Our focus was on localizing target objects in the real-world environment. Our solution involved building a prototype drone, which would fly around, take images of the area below it, detect the target objects and localize them.

To learn more about the project and see our drone in action, check out our [project website](https://eanayag.com/uav-search/).
